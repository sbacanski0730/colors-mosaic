# About the project and its developer
I'm developing this project as a proof to my skills in Web Development. 
The idea for this project arose from the need for a tool that would enable easy search for colors in web design, which can be used as colors for fonts, logos, texts and backgrounds.
It has already occurred to me that when creating a project, the most difficult thing for me is finding and matching colors to the project. For this reason, I started looking for tools that would make it easier for me, and that's when I realized that I could try to create such a tool myself.

My plan for this project is to create a page with contains three view for three different set of colors. User can create his own account which will enable this opportunity to collect favorites color as single colors and colors sets.

A few thing in the project could be design and code better. I am aware of this and I treat it as an opportunity to grow as a developer.
If you have any comments or advice to my code, let me know.
